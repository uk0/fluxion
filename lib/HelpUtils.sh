  NAME
         fluxion  -  Fluxion  is  a  security  auditing  and  social-engineering
         research tool

  SYNOPSIS
         fluxion [-debug] [-l language ] [-m] [--auto] [--scan-time N] attack ...

  DESCRIPTION
         fluxion is a security auditing and  social-engineering  research  tool.
         It  is  a remake of linset by vk496 with (hopefully) less bugs and more
         functionality. The script attempts to retrieve the WPA/WPA2 key from  a
         target  access point by means of a social engineering (phising) attack.
         It's compatible with the latest release of  Kali  (rolling).  Fluxion's
         attacks'  setup  is  mostly  manual, but experimental auto-mode handles
         some of the attacks' setup parameters.

  OPTIONS
         -v     Print version number.

         --help Print help page and exit with 0.

         -m     Use tmux multiplexer instead of xterm. Enables headless
                operation without an X11/graphical session. If not already
                inside a tmux session, fluxion will re-exec itself inside
                one. All sub-windows are opened as tmux windows instead of
                xterm terminals.

         --auto Run fluxion in fully non-interactive auto mode. Every
                interactive prompt auto-selects a sensible default. Implies
                --killer (-k). In auto mode, fluxion runs one attack cycle
                and exits (no looping). Best combined with -m for headless
                operation.

         --scan-time <seconds>
                Duration in seconds for the wireless scanner in auto mode.
                Default is 30. After this time, the scanner is killed and
                results are processed. Only meaningful with --auto or
                --scan-only.

         --scan-only
                Scan for nearby WPA networks, print results to stdout, and
                exit. Does not launch any attack. Implies --auto and -k.
                Use with --scan-time to control scan duration and -c to
                restrict channels. Output is a machine-friendly table.

         --list-interfaces
                List all detected wireless network interfaces with their
                driver, chipset, bus type, and state, then exit.

         --interface <iface>
                Use the specified wireless interface for scanning and
                operations. If not given, the first available wireless
                interface is used.

         --jammer-interface <iface>
                Use the specified wireless interface for the deauth jammer
                (Captive Portal attack). Overrides auto-selection for this
                role only.

         --ap-interface <iface>
                Use the specified wireless interface for the rogue access
                point (Captive Portal attack). Overrides auto-selection for
                this role only.

         --tracker-interface <iface>
                Use the specified wireless interface for the target tracker
                (channel-change detection). In auto mode the tracker is
                disabled unless this option is given.

         -k     Kill interfering wireless processes (NetworkManager, etc.)
                before allocating interfaces. Implied by --auto.

         -d     Run fluxion in debug mode.

         -r     Reload driver.

         -l <language>
                Define a certain language. In auto mode, defaults to \"en\".

         -e <essid>
                Select the target network based on the ESSID. In auto mode,
                used to filter scan results to the matching network.

         -c <channel>
                Indicate the channel(s) to listen to. In auto mode, the
                scanner is restricted to these channels.

         -a <attack>
                Define a certain attack. In auto mode, this selects the
                attack type without prompting.

         --ratio <ratio>
                Define the windows size. Bigger ratio ->  smaller  window  size.
                Default is 4. Only applies in xterm mode.

         -b <bssid>
                Select the target network based on the access point MAC address.
                In auto mode, used to filter scan results.

         -j <jamming interface>
                Define a certain jamming interface.

         -a <access point interface>
                Define a certain access point interface.

  EXAMPLES

         # List networks on channel 6 only:
         sudo ./fluxion.sh -m --scan-only --scan-time 30 -c 6

         # Headless, non-interactive, 15-second scan:
         sudo ./fluxion.sh -m --auto -l en --scan-time 15

         # Headless with specific target:
